    <h1>Feels Good to be Back!</h1>

    <p>Lately, I have been relearning a lot of material from my previous courses. 
    I am excited to be back into programming; my classes last semester were all
    theory and hardware. I have been studying non-stop since Monday. I am graduating 
    at the end of this semester, and I want to make sure I finish strong! I had to put 
    my hobbies on hold—I was designing a <strong>3D-printed tavern</strong> for a 
    <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/dungeons-dragons/">pinball game</a> I own.
    It came out so well that I am going to try and sell it online. I have been optimizing 
    the multicolor transitions for the print as I go. One tavern initially took 
    <strong>2 days</strong> and <strong>1,000 grams</strong> of filament to print. 
    I touched up the paint job in the slicer to reduce filament swaps that happened 
    in unnecessary spots. I've now gotten it down to <strong>700 grams</strong> and 
    <strong>1 day and 22 hours</strong> of print time. The second one is printing as I 
    type this. It's almost done!</p>
